Learn how to use reactive JAX-RS client to invoke RESTful microservices over HTTP asynchronously.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use reactive JAX-RS client to access remote RESTful services using asynchronous method calls. You'll update an existing usage of the client to call the `rx()` method while will wrap your response in a `CompletionStage`. A `CompletionStage` is an interface that will allow you to use the result of your remote service call at some point in the future.

*What is asynchronous programming?* +
Asynchronous programming can be thought of as a restaurant. After being seated, a waiter will take your order. At this point, you will have to wait a few minutes for your food to be prepared. While your food is being prepared your waiter may take more orders or serve other tables. Once your food is ready, your waiter will be notified to bring out your food. However, in a synchronous model, the waiter would have to wait for your food to be prepared before dealing with any other customers. This method blocks other customers from placing orders or receiving their food.

Asynchronous methods allow you to perform a lengthy operation, such as input/output (I/O) asynchronously. This means that the I/O occurs in the background and the caller is notified via a callback to continue with their computation once it’s complete. The benefit is that this frees up the original thread to handle other work rather than waiting on I/O to complete. Going back to the restaurant analogy, food is prepared asynchronously in the kitchen and your waiter is freed up to attend to other tables. Since they’re free, the waiter can take more orders from other tables, or serve food to other tables.

In the context of REST clients, making synchronous HTTP requests can be a time consuming process. The network may be slow, or maybe the upstream service is overwhelmed and can't respond quickly. These lengthy operations can block the execution of your thread when it's in use and prevent other work from being completed.

The application you will be working with is a job manager that maintains an inventory of available systems.
It consists of four microservices, `gateway`, `job`, `system`, and `inventory`.
The `job` microservice allows you to dispatch jobs that will be run by the `system` microservice.
The job is a sleep operation used to represent a slow task that lasts for a duration of 5 to 10 seconds. When it completes, the `system` microservice
reports the sleep time as the result of this job. In addition to running jobs, the `system` microservice also registers
itself on startup with the `inventory` microservice that keeps track of all instances of the `system` microservice. Finally,
the `gateway` microservice is a https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html#variation-backends-for-frontends[backend for frontend^] service.
It communicates with the backend `job` and `inventory` microservices on the caller's behalf.

image::reactive-inventory-system.png[Reactive Inventory System,align="center"]

The microservice that you will modify is the `gateway` service.
It acts as a gateway to communicate with the backend microservices.
Whenever a request is made to the `gateway` service to retrieve the jobs
the `gateway` service communicates with the `job`
service to get the completed jobs.

The implementations of the application and its services are provided for you in the `start/src` directory.
The application also uses the Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper services to distribute the job results and system status.

== Using the default reactive JAX-RS client

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

An implementation of the default JAX-RS client is already provided for you. The application functions similarly to the one created in our https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-rest-client-async.html[template interfaces guide]. The classes changed are `JobClient` and `GatewayJobResource` which now implement the default JAX-RS reactive client.
In both classes, notice how each method (getJobs(), getJob(), createJob()) returns a `CompletionStage<T>`. This interface represents a unit or stage of a computation. Once the associated computation completes, the value contained can then be retrieved. Alternatively, the CompletionStage can be chained with additional stages using the `thenApplyAsync()` method for further processing. Exceptions can be handled in a callback provided to the `exceptionally()` method. The `thenApplyAsync()` and `exceptionally()` methods together behave like an asynchronous try-catch block. It is important to note that when you return a CompletionStage in the resource, it doesn't guarantee that computation is complete and that the response has been built. Rather, it just means that the service will respond to the caller once the CompletionStage has completed.

In the `JobClient` class, there are additional methods used to create, and configure the JAX-RS client. Also note how the other methods all contain an `rx()` call. This is the default reactive invoker for CompletionStage and this method is what retrieves the `CompletionStageRxInvoker` and allows for these methods to fucntion correctly with the CompletionStage return type.

In the `GatewayJobResource` class, the desired return type is returned in the `thenApplyAsync()` method.

Similarly to the synchronous approach, if we successfully get the completed jobs from the job microservice, then the resource will respond with an HTTP status of 200 and the body will contain a list of jobs.


== Updating the client to support third-party objects

JAX-RS supports the usage of third-party libraries like https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey[Jersey^], and can allow for client configurations that are different from the default one.

By using Jersey, the client can be updated to support https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[ReactiveX^] objects instead of only CompletionStage types.

pom.xml
[source,xml,linenums,role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/pom.xml[]
----

The ReactiveX API and the required Jersey libraries are included as dependencies to your `pom.xml` file. Look for the depedencies with `rxjava`, `jersey-client`, `jersey-rx-client-rxjava` and `jersey-rx-client-rxjava2`respectively as their artidactIDs.

[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/gateway/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/gateway/client/JobClient.java[]
----

The changes involve changing the return types of `getJobs()`, `getJob()` and `createJob()` from `CompletionStage<T>` to `Observable<T>`. The `http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/io/reactivex/Observable.html[Observable^]` type is an object that is part of ReactiveX and, as will be seen later, is a more flexible data type than the CompletionStage.
The `rx()` invoker also contains `RxObservableInvoker.class` as an argument; This is to invoke the specific invoker for the Observable class provided by Jersey. The invoker depends on the type of object you wish to return, if you wanted to return a `http://reactivex.io/RxJava/2.x/javadoc/io/reactivex/Flowable.html[Flowable^]` instead, you would need to pass `RxFlowableInvoker.class`. For this to work however, the invoker would need to have a provider that is registered with the client. Notice in the `webTarget()` method the `register(RxObservableInvokerProvider)` call that allows for the client to recognize the `RxObservableInvoker` class. Without registering the invoker provider, the invoker will not be recognized.


== Updating the JAX resources

Now that the client methods return `Observable<T>`, you must update the resource to accomodate these changes. Instead of using `thenApplyAsync()`, observables use the `subscribe()` method to asynchronously process data. Thus any required processing of data will be performed in this method; In this case, it is simply saving the data in the temporary holder.

GatewayJobResource.java
[source, Java, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=copyright']
----
include::finish/gateway/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/gateway/GatewayJobResource.java[]
----

A temporary holder is used to store the value returned from the client because values cannot be returned inside `subscribe()`. The `countdownLatch.await()` will ensure that the function will only return a value once the required item (i.e Job, JobResult, JobList) is ready. The `CountdownLatch` will countdown towards 0 after the completion of a thread via the `countdownLatch.countdown()` call. This means that the value will only return once the thread in charge of retrieving said value is complete. While waiting for this countdown to occur, the main thread is free to perform other tasks. In this case, no such task is present, but a simple task can be given to occupy the thread.

// Building the application
// =================================================================================================

== Building and running the application

The `gateway`, `job`, `system`, and `inventory` microservices will be built in a Docker container. You can learn more about https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^].

Install Docker by following the instructions on the https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation[official page^]. Start your Docker environment.

To build the application, run the Maven `install` goal from the command line in the `start` directory.

[role='command']
```
mvn clean install
```

Run the following commands to build and containerize the application:

[role='command']
```
docker build -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
docker build -t job:1.0-SNAPSHOT job/.
docker build -t gateway:1.0-SNAPSHOT gateway/.
```

Next, use the provided script to start the application in Docker containers. The script creates a network for the containers to communicate with each other. It also creates containers for Kafka, Zookeeper, and all of the microservices in the project.

****
[system]#*{linux} | {mac}*#

[role='command']
```
./scripts/start-app
```

[system]#*{win}*#

[role='command']
```
.\scripts\start-app.bat
```
****

The services will take some time to become available.
You can access the application by making requests to the `gateway` job endpoints.

[options="header", role="wrap_table"]
|===
|Description |Endpoint |Sample Output
|Get completed jobs |GET http://localhost:8080/api/jobs[http://localhost:8080/api/jobs^] |`{"count":0,"results":[]}`
|Create a job |POST \http://localhost:8080/api/jobs |`{"jobId":"661891cb-ad36-4ef4-9bb3-641f973f2964"}`
|Get a specific job |GET \http://localhost:8080/api/jobs/{jobId} |`{"jobId":"661891cb-ad36-4ef4-9bb3-641f973f2964","result":5}`
|===
Before any jobs are created, the output will be simply `{"count":0,"results":[]}`, representing that no jobs have been created.

You can use `curl -X POST \http://localhost:8080/api/jobs` command if available on the system to create a job. The Postman application can also be used. The request will take some time for the job results to return.

The completed jobs JSON output has an `averageResult` attribute that is the average sleep time of all the jobs, a count for the number of jobs and the list of the jobs. The JSON output for each job has a job ID and a sleep time as the result for this job.

Switching to an asynchronous programming model has freed up the thread handling your request to `/api/jobs`. While the client request is being handled, the thread can handle other work.

== Testing the gateway application

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the `gateway` microservice. If a test failure occurs, then you may have introduced a bug into the code.

[role="code_command hotspot", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `GatewayJobEndpointIT` class.#
`gateway/src/test/java/it/io/openliberty/guides/gateway/GatewayJobEndpointIT.java`
----

See the following descriptions of the test cases:

* [hotspot=testCreateJob file=0]`testCreateJob()` verifies that the gateway service communicates with a backend service to create a job.

* [hotspot=testGetJobs file=0]`testGetJobs()` verifies that the gateway service communicates with an upstream service to get all jobs and transforms them appropriately to a `JobListModel`.

// Running the tests
// =================================================================================================

=== Running the tests

Navigate to the `gateway` directory, then verify that the tests pass using the Maven `verify` goal:

[role='command']
```
mvn verify
```

When the tests succeed, you will see output similar to the following.

[source, role='no_copy']

== Teardown

Navigate back to the `start` directory.

Finally, use the script to stop the application.

****
[system]#*{linux} | {mac}*#

[role='command']
```
./scripts/stop-app
```

[system]#*{win}*#

[role='command']
```
